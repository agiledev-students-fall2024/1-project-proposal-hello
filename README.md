# EasyNote
## What and Why
EasyNote is a productivity web application designed to centralize productivity tools, including notetaking, task management, and more. There is a lot of organizational and productivity software already available on the market, but they often do not work in conjunction with one another and are heavily independent of each other, making it inconvenient for the user to keep track of all of their productivity information in one place. One app that aims to centralize these tools is Notion, but Notion has an abundance of complex functionality that requires a learning curve and certain users may be apprehensive about diving into an app with that much functionality and open-endedness--that's where EasyNote comes in. EasyNote aims to centralize the core productivity tools without the extra fluff that a lot of users won't end up using, keeping their workflow simple and straightforward.
## For Whom
* Casual Users: those who are no frills or gimmicks when it comes to productivity; they do not need personalization aspects and simply want a reliable and convenient productivity app
* Efficiency Enthusiasts: those who are hardcore about their work efficiency and want to maintain a lean workflow--they do not want to get bogged down by an abundance of extra features, but also value that this app satisfies all of their use cases and helps to drive efficiency
* Small Businesses: entities that do not have an incredible amount of data/information that they need to maintain. This could be a mom-and-pop shop that needs to track their operations on a small scale, without the need for added complexity and project management tools that bigger companies have.
## How
* Note-taking pages -- like Apple Notes with minimal functionality
* Calendar
* Task Manager -- recording pending items in a vertical, chronological order, or using a Kanban board
## Scope
* Note-taking pages
* Calendar
* Task Manager
* If time/resources allows: integration with Google Calendar--someone will be able to extend a Google Calendar invite from the EasyNote app
